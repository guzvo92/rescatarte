## Background

We are a team made up of 5 people. We are doing social work focused on street animals. Our focus is to rescue, support and care.

We will be supporting several foundations with their help with the purchase of some nfts with which we will have some stages within it, such as step 1, rescue, feed, sterilize and ending with adoption, there are 70 percent of the animals on the streets which are injured, used for non-profit I mean for profit they hurt the dogs or kittens appear in an inhumane way for this we want to solve perhaps not the same 70 percent that I was commenting on, but perhaps lower it to 50 or 30 ⁇ always with some support it is done the difference we hope to have your help either tell a friend share it or buy it.

## The Collection
Thinking at improve the way of founding, audited and trace the founds we receive we will divide the amounts in 70% destined to the idea and 30% for operations. Theres is a Genesis free mint collection for perform the Proof of concept before getting the real amounts.
